Ilana is interested in the polarization process of macrophages, specifically
how individual cells activate and regulate their polarization responses when
they encounter complex or conflicting cues from the environment. Using
live-cell microscopy and flow cytometry, she is investigating the signaling
events, gene transcription, and protein production of various polarization
pathways to elucidate the plasticity and mechanism of polarization decisions in
complex environments, such as might be encountered in the tumor
microenvironment. Ilana received her Ph.D. from Harvard University, where she
studied the regulation of the proto-oncogene PIM3 by mTORC1 in Brendan
Manning’s lab.  She received Bachelor’s degrees in Biochemistry and Biology at
the University of Maryland.
