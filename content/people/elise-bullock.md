Elise studies signaling and transcriptional regulation of HIV latency using
computational and experimental approaches. Her goal is to understand how
signaling and transcriptional heterogeneity control viral phenotypes when
coupled to feedback control. Her interests include systems biology,
computational modeling, and synthetic biological circuits. Elise is a member of
the Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology and is
supported by the program’s NIH T32 training grant. She received her Bachelor’s
degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas.
