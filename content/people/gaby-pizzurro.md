Gaby studies macrophage heterogeneity in the melanoma tumor microenvironment. 
She developed in vitro 3D co-cultures to explore how fibroblasts and tumor cells 
shape the functional phenotypes of macrophages in the early stages of tumor 
development. She is also exploring how the timing of treatment with agonistic CD40 
in the preclinical melanoma model alters myeloid cell states and their interactions 
with other cell types and myeloid subsets in the TME. Gaby received her PhD in 
Biological Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aires.
