Victor is studying how cell-to-cell heterogeneity in NF-kB dynamics and
chromatin environment combine to regulate transcriptional activation of latent
HIV. He is using a combination of live-cell imaging and single molecular
fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to observe latent HIV activation in
single cells. His interests include molecular biology, microscopy, biological
noise and signal transduction. Victor received his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology
from the University of Pennsylvania.
