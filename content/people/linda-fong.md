Linda's research focuses on the temporal dynamics of phosphoproteins in the
reactivation of latent HIV. Through systems analysis and multivariate
regression modeling, her work aims to elucidate key signaling pathways which
can predict network responses to pharmacologic intervention. Her research
interests involve using data-driven models of cell signaling to approach
problems in oncology and infectious diseases. Linda earned her BS from MIT in
Biological Engineering (Course XX) with a minor in Science, Technology, and
Society and a concentration in Ethics.
