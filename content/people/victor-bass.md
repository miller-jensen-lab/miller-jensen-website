Victor studies how single cell heterogeneity in NF-kB dynamics affects
transcription of inflammatory genes in different chromatin environments. He
uses a combination of live-cell imaging and single molecule fluorescence in
situ hybridization to measure NF-ÎºB dynamics and quantify transcript output in
the same single cells. His research interests include single-cell
heterogeneity, signal transduction, and fluorescence microscopy. He received
his Bachelor's in Biological Sciences from Carnegie Mellon University with a
minor in Chemistry.
