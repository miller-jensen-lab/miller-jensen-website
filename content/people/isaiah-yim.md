Isaiah is using synthetic molecular approach to study the role of TNF paracrine signaling cytokine in propagating the pro-inflammatory signal as well as triggering the anti-inflammatory response via IL-10 signaling. He is interested in how these extracellular networks generate spatial patterns of inflammation that might be important in tissue microenvironments requiring local control, such as the brain. Isaiah received his B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Michigan.
