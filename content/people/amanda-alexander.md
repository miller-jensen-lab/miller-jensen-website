heterogeneity in the inflammatory response in macrophages. She is interested in
how dysregulation of intercellular heterogeneity in inflammation may contribute
to autoimmune diseases. Amanda is supported by an NSF Graduate Research
Fellowship. She received her Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from Spelman
College with additional coursework in Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia
Institute of Technology.
