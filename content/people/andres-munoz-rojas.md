Andrés is investigating the paradoxical role of macrophages in promoting and
destroying tumors. Using a novel microfluidic device, he is studying the
signaling dynamics of single macrophages and correlating it to downstream
protein secretion signatures in the same single cell. His interests include
cancer immunology, microscopy, systems biology and signal transduction. Andrés
received his Bachelor’s degree in Bioengineering from the University of
Pennsylvania with a minor in Music.
