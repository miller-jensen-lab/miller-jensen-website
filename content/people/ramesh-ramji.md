Ramesh likes to invent novel integrated micro analytical devices for biological
applications. With a PhD in bioengineering (microfluidic cell based assays)
from the National University of Singapore (NUS), he dwells into areas including
nanobiotechnology, bioimaging, analytical chemistry and instrumentation. He is
currently developing a high throughput multiplexed microfluidic device to
quantify signaling dynamics and endpoint protein secretion at the "single cell"
level.
