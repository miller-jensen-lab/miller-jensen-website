Laura is studying the role of p38 kinase signaling in the regulation of IL-6
following TLR stimulation. She uses both single-cell and cell-population
approaches to understand how intercellular signaling heterogeneity translates
to variability in cytokine secretion. Laura received her Bachelorâ€™s degree in
Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology from Yale University.
