Janani is studying interactions between melanoma tumor cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts using a tumor spheroid model to recapitulate the physical properties of the tumor, including direct cell-cell interactions and spatial orientation of cells. She aims to spatially map different macrophage subpopulations and their functionality within the spheroid in order to understand the evolution of the immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype in early melanoma. Janani received her B.S. in and her M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Tufts University.
