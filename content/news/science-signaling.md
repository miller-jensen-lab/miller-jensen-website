Qiong and Yao compared data from isolated single-cell assays to data from
populations of cells to demonstrate that [paracrine signaling is essential for
stimulating a full LPS secretion
response](https://stke.sciencemag.org/content/8/381/ra59) in macrophages.
Markus applied data-driven modeling of the single-cell data to identify the
most crucial paracrine signals regulating the response.
