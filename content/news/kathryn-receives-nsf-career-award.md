Kathryn was selected to receive the [2015 NSF CAREER
Award](https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/kathryn-miller-jensen-receives-2015-nsf-career-award)
for our group's project, "Reverse Engineering the Inflammatory Signaling
Network from Single-Cell Data." The award provides $500,000 in funding to
researchers who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars. The CAREER Award is the
NSF’s most prestigious award for junior faculty.

This project examines why genetically identical macrophages — the first
responders in the immune system — vary in how strongly they respond to the
presence of pathogens by secreting pro-inflammatory "danger signals." Using
state-of-the-art experimental tools for single-cell analysis, our group is
identifying the sources of heterogeneity from transcription to secretion of
proteins used for intracellular communication. These experiments are used to
fit a mathematical model of signaling, cytokine secretion, and diffusion fit to
single-cell data so that we can make predictions about emergent population
behavior.
