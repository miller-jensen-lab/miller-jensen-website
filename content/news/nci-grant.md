Our lab was recently [awarded a $2.8M grant](https://www.yalecancercenter.org/news-article/25615/)
from the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) to support our work with the
[Bosenberg lab](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/marcus_bosenberg/) through the 
[Yale Cancer Center](https://www.yalecancercenter.org/). We are, of course, enormously
grateful for NCI's support for this important work in which we'll be 
modeling and evaluating cytokine signaling related to cancer immunotherapy.
