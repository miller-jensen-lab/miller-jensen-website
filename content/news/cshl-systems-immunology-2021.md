Kathryn co-organized the [second Systems Immunology conference at Cold Spring
Harbor
Laboratory](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=SYSIMM&year=21). Alas,
due to the Covid-19 crisis, the conference was virtual this year. 
The conference included three days of amazing cross-disciplinary research.
